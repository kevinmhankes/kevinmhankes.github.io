<p>Hello! I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at Nelnet specializing in mobile development on Android and iOS.
	Nelnet's mobile tech stack consists of Java for native Android development and the Titanium Appcelerator platform for iOS.
	I enjoy challenging myself to learn new frameworks and technologies so I am currently developing some personal apps with Swift on iOS and Kotlin on Android.
	More recently I've been working on some Jeopardy apps to help my brother study for a possible appearance on the show!
	I'm also very interested in expanding my knowledge on Machine Learning and possible applications of ML to some of my applications.
	If you have any questions feel free to send me a message on my LinkedIn!
